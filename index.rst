Pytnon-FTN: API and tools for Fidonet and other FTN networks
============================================================

Python-FTN is a set of Python modules that provide the following
capabilities:

- Generating FTN messages.
- Editing message data.
- Displaying and querying message data.
- Packing/unpacking FTN mail packets.
- Editing packet data.
- Displaying and querying packet data.
- Parsing and querying FTN nodelists.
- Making routing decsisions from nodelist data.

The python-ftn API makes it easy to develop new tools that interact
with FTN format data.

Python-ftn supports FTS-0001 "on disk" and "packed" messages (and can
convert between them), and supports both FTS-0001 ("type 2") and
FSC-0048 ("type 2+") packets.
